BuildCamp-July-2014
===================

for Microsoft BuildCamp Project



Note: I(Amit) started the index.html, but it is not complete.  Bootstrap is new to me and I havent used html
in a long time... Tommorow I need to ask you guys some questions on bootstrap.

I would work on this further and learn more bootsrap, but I have a Stats test tommorow and have to study for it(its early in the morning)


Also, is there a way I can post comments on github without editing the readme?
